# One Tap Software homepage source code

There's nothing too special about the code for this site.
I originally built it with Stencil and Tachyons but switched to Vue and Tachyons after bumping into some Stencil Router issues.
I'm mostly posting it as a demonstration for my tachyons cheat sheet, which can be found here:
